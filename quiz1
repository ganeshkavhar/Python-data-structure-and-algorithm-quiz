1. What does g(31415927) return, for the following function definition?
  def g(x):
    (q,d) = (1,0)
    while q <= x:
      (q,d) = (q*10,d+1)
    return(d)
Ans = 8


2. What is the value of h(231,8) for the function below?
  def h(m,n):
    ans = 0
    while (m >= n):
      (ans,m) = (ans+1,m-n) 
    return(ans)

Ans = 28

3. Consider the following function h.
  def h(n):
    f = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
      if n%i == 0:
        f = f + 1
    return(f%2 == 1)
The function h(n) given above returns True for a positive number n whenever:
a) n is a multiple of 2
b) n is a composite number
c) n is a prime number
d) n is a perfect square

Ans = d


4. Consider the following function f.
  def f(m):
    if m == 0:
      return(0)
    else:
      return(m+f(m-1))
Which of the following is correct?
a) The function always terminates with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
b) The function always terminates with f(n) = factorial of n
c) The function terminates for non-negative n with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
d) The function terminates for non-negative n with f(n) = factorial of n

Ans = c
